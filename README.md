# Scheduling-Algorithms

// ANISHA PRAKASH
// 2021csb1067

It is an implementation of three types of schedulers(First Come First Serve, Shortest Job First, Round Robin).

This folder consists of three .cpp files (FCFS.cpp, SJF.cpp and RR.cpp ) and a process.txt.
process.txt is a sample input of processes with other informations(arrival time,total execution time,burst time,I/O time, priority)

FCFS.cpp: it is the First Come First Serve Scheduling implementation in C++ language
SJF.cpp: it is Shortest Job First implementation in C++ language
RR.cpp: it is the Round Robin implementation in C++ language

\*\*\* How to run the program:
Compile the file and run the executable file. A prompt will appear in the terminal , asking for the input file to be read.
Make sure that the file you are giving should contain all the necessary informations of each process in an order
In case of Round Robin Scheduling, it will also ask for the Quantum no/ time-slice.

    Each process should contain the following informations in the order as given:
    Process_no, arrival time, total execution time, burst time, I/O time, priority

It will give the Turn Around Time and Total wait Time of each process along with the average time for processes to complete and
standard deviation for the average process completion time
